## Description
This application uses express, handlebars, and mysql to allow users to create and devour burgers!

## Installation Instructions
This project is deployed on Heroku, so following this link: https://secure-coast-61532.herokuapp.com/ will lead you to the deployed app.

## Usage Information
Created burgers are appended to the left-side column of the page, and each burger has a devour button. Created burgers will be added to the databse. Once devoured, the burger will be appended to the right-side devour column of the page, so you can see all of the burgers that you have devoured.
